<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Emmanuelle Lenge, and I am currently a third-year student at the University of Maine, majoring in Computer Science. I am deeply passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers, which is why I am pursuing a degree in this field. My goal is to become a skilled web developer and, hopefully, land a job that will enable me to excel in this field and become one of the best in the industry.</p>

<p>My journey began in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I was born. In 2018, I made a significant move to America in search of better opportunities and a brighter future. This transition has been both challenging and rewarding, as it has allowed me to grow personally and academically.</p>

<p>I am taking this course to deepen my understanding of web development and gain the practical skills needed to build functional, aesthetically pleasing, and user-friendly websites. I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead. I am committed to continuous learning and improvement, and I am eager to contribute to the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>

<p>When I'm not studying or working on web development projects, I enjoy reading and learning new skills. These activities help me maintain a balanced lifestyle and inspire creativity in my work.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my page. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities in the world of web development.</p>
